## 🩺 Project Overview  
Floora, founded by Dr. Loretta Barry, is a pelvic health practice dedicated to helping pregnant and postpartum women regain strength, confidence, and comfort through **evidence-based physical therapy**.

To enhance the quality and consistency of client care, this project is developing the Floora HEP digital platform, which includes a client mobile application (iOS & Android) and an admin dashboard website. The platform provides an integrated system for managing exercises, tracking progress, and improving communication between clients and practitioners — reflecting Floora’s premium standard of care.

## ⚙️ Problem Statement  
Floora currently relies on handwritten exercise instructions, leading to inefficiency, fragmented communication, and limited scalability. This manual approach does not reflect the practice’s modern, high-quality service model.  

A secure and user-friendly digital solution is being developed to streamline exercise management, centralize client data, and enhance the overall client experience. The dedicated web and mobile platform aims to modernize operations, improve accessibility, and support Floora’s mission to deliver professional, seamless pelvic health care.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The objective of this project is to modernize Floora’s exercise management system by replacing the current manual, handwritten process with a digital, scalable solution.  

The system will:  
- Improve efficiency, consistency, and personalization in delivering home exercise programs (HEP)  
- Enhance client experience with access to exercises, progress tracking, and communication  
- Empower Floora’s staff to manage clients, update content, and monitor outcomes in real time  

---

## 💻 Proposed Solution  
The proposed solution is a custom-built digital platform consisting of:  

- Mobile App for clients: secure access to personalized programs, videos, and progress tracking  
- Admin Dashboardfor staff: manage accounts, curate and assign exercises, and track outcomes  

Together, these tools create an integrated, efficient ecosystem** that supports Floora’s mission of empowering women with accessible, high-quality pelvic health care.

---

## 🌟 Expected Outcome  
The implementation of the Floora HEP digital platform will:  
- Streamline operations and reduce admin workload  
- Provide clients with a modern, seamless interface  
- Improve program accuracy, engagement, and adherence  
- Enhance scalability while maintaining Floora’s premium care standard  

Overall, this solution will strengthen Floora’s brand as a leader in evidence-based pelvic health care.
